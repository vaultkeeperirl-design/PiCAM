## 2025-02-24 - Initial Release v0.1.0

**Observation:** Project is functional but lacks formal release infrastructure (versioning, changelog, automated releases).
**Action:**
- Established baseline version `v0.1.0`.
- Implemented Semantic Versioning.
- Created `CHANGELOG.md` to track changes.
- Created GitHub Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) to automate artifact generation.
