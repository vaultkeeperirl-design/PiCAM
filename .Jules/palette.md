## 2024-05-22 - Dual-Channel Feedback for Critical Warnings
**Learning:** Relying solely on color (green vs red) for critical warnings like audio clipping is insufficient for accessibility (color blindness) and quick scanning.
**Action:** Always pair color changes with explicit text labels (e.g., "CLIP!") or icons to ensure the warning is communicated through multiple channels.

**Learning:** Direct text overlays on live video feeds often suffer from poor contrast against bright or complex scenes, making them inaccessible.
**Action:** Wrap informational overlays (like help menus or alerts) in semi-transparent modal containers with dark backgrounds to guarantee readability regardless of the camera subject.
